# Hotheaded VS Code

Are red squiggly lines not enough?  
Do you wish for more of a kick when you make an error?  
Have VS Code scream at you whenever you type something that isn't correct.

## Features

* â˜  Makes me want to die
* ðŸ˜± VS Code literally screams at you the second something's wrong

## To Do

* ðŸ’¬ It does scream now, but it's in my voice. Should probably get a better
  voice actor.
